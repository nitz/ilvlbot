# ilvlbot
A Discord bot that fetches World of Warcraft character info

## Building

Fire up Visual Studio 2017 and smash build. It should grab the required nuget packages and go to town.

## Running

You'll need to set up a few configuation options. Run the compiled binary once and it'll spit out a default `settings.conf` for you. Add your Discord and battlenet API keys and you should be solid.

## Todo

Provide some useful info on what is actually going on here.
